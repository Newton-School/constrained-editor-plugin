# Restrictions Object

Restrictions Object is used to control the editable area in the editor.

## Structure of Restrictions object

List of all the valid keys which can be given in the Restrictions object.

### Range

- **Required Field** : This has to be an Array(4), with all the entries being a **positive whole number**.

This field will be used to construct the editable range of the editor.

```javascript
const restrictions = {
  range: [1, 7, 1, 13],
};
```

### AllowMultiline

This is an **Optional** Field. This should be of type **Boolean**.

This field will be used to flag the plugin whether to allow new line `\n` character (or) not.

### Label

This is an **Optional** Field. This should be of type **String**.

:::danger

Treat this label as an unique ID, and **don't declare two restrictions with same label.**

:::

### Validate

This is an **Optional** Field. This should be of type **Function**.

This callback can be used to validate the value entered in the editable area.
If **returned false**, then that content will not be added to the editable area.

Validate callback will be called with three arguments, 
1. CurrentValue - Will have the current value with the edited content
2. CurrentRange - Will have the new range with the edited content
3. Info - Will have the info about the edit location

:::tip

**Returning undefined** will not be considered as a falsy value here.
Only **false** can prevent the content addition, all other values will be considered as truthy.

:::

:::danger

There is no debounce happening in calling the validate function.
If you feel, **please implement the debounce inside the validate function**

:::

### Sample Restrictions

```javascript
const singleLineRestriction = {
  range: [1, 7, 1, 13],
  label: "someUniqueLabel",
};

const multiLineRestriction = {
  range: [3, 1, 4, 1],
  label: "someUniqueLabel_1",
  allowMultiline: true,
};

const restrictionWithValidate = {
  range: [3, 1, 4, 1],
  label: "someUniqueLabel_2",
  allowMultiline: true,
  validate: function (currentValue, currentRange, info) {
    const someRegex = /^[a-z0-9A-Z]*$/;
    return someRegex.test(currentlyTypedValue);
  },
};
```
