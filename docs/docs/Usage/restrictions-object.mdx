# Restrictions Object

Restrictions Object is used to control the editable area in the editor.

## Structure of Restrictions object

List of all the valid keys which can be given in the Restrictions object.

### Range

- **Required Field** : This has to be an Array(4), with all the entries being a **positive whole number**.

This field will be used to construct the editable range of the editor.

```javascript
const restrictions = {
  range: [1, 7, 1, 13]
};
```

### AllowMultiline

This is an **Optional** Field. This should be of type **Boolean**. 

This field will be used to flag the plugin whether to allow new line `\n` character (or) not.

### Label

This is an **Optional** Field. This should be of type **String**.

:::danger

Treat this label as an unique ID, and **don't declare two restrictions with same label.**

:::

### Validate

This is an **Optional** Field. This should be of type **Function**.

This callback can be used to validate the value entered in the editable area. 
If **returned false**, then that content will not be added to the editable area.

:::tip

**Returning undefined** will not be considered as a falsy value here.
Only **false** can prevent the content addition, all other values will be considered as truthy.

:::

:::danger

There is no debounce happening in calling the validate function. 
If you feel, **please implement the debounce inside the validate function**
